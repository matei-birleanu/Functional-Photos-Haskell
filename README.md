Stage 1: Shallow Embedding
Implement a concrete representation of images using characteristic functions (Point â†’ Bool).
Define functions for simple regions (rectangles, circles), combining regions, drawing regions, and applying transformations (translations, scaling).


Stage 2: Deep Embedding
Develop an abstract syntax tree (AST) for regions and transformations.
Implement functions to interpret ASTs and convert them into concrete representations.
Optimize transformations within the AST.


Stage 3: Advanced Interpretation and Optimization
Further explore the interpretation of ASTs.
Implement advanced optimization techniques for combining and simplifying transformations.
